Heading 2: A simpler way to do EMR.

Raw Text: Micro EMR is a simplified electronic medical records software. It allows health practitioners to easily maintain records of patient visits.

Heading 2: Features
Bullet Points: Speech-to-text recording of patient info and condition. Ability to correct dictation.
Functionality to capture a photo of patient and attach to that patient's profile. Assess patient's priority (high/medium/low/resolved).

Heading 2: Control Flow
Bullet Points:
The user is presented with a screen asking to either begin a new record or view patient records.
Similar to the To-Do list app, the patient records will have a searchable view of patient profiles (just like items previously).
When a patient profile is chosen, another view of all of a particular patient's records is displayed (sorted by timestamp).
From the list of all of a particular patient's records, the user can edit a specific record.
If beginning a new record, a new view will ask to write the patient's name.
The patient will be checked against the database. 
If the patient is new, the user will need to take the patient's picture, write patient's info, dictate patient's
condition/diagnosis/medication/priority, record timestamp.
Otherwise, the picture and patient info are skipped and the new record is appended to that patient's list of records.
Finally, when finishing creating/editing a record, the user can save a current record or cancel.
